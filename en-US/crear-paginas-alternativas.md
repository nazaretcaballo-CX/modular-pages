# Create alternative pages

Just as you can configure [alternative modules](como-crear-una-pagina-modular/contenido.md#crear-un-grupo-de-modulos-alternativos), you can also create alternative pages.

In some circumstances, you may need to create the same page multiple times so that it appears differently for certain groups of users.

If this is the case, click **+Add new page** on the corresponding page on the main pages screen.

Since you need to add an audience for this new page, it makes sense for you to have a new "version" of said page for a given audience.

Here is one such example:

*Alice is creating an app home page with several modules. She knows that, for a certain group of users who have just registered with the app and as such do not have a username yet, that home page will appear different.*

*What does Alice do?*

*Once the home page has been created with the modules, she creates an alternative page indicating that said page is intended for users with the `new-user` audience. She includes a single module on that page which only contains the frequently asked questions (FAQs) access module.*

*This allows Alice to better manage the content that is shown to different users.*

Another example of very frequent use is when the pages are related to products. In this case, it can be very useful, and even necessary, to create alternative pages.

*Here is one such example:*

*Alice needs to create the mobile line home page for the app. However, these pages are related to the mobile product and vary depending on whether the user is pre-paid, post-paid with a contracted plan or if they have a non-contracted post-paid line.*

*To do this, Alice creates three alternative pages, one for each situation. She indicates the corresponding audiences and the modules to be added for each page.*

### How to sort alternative pages

You must sort pages so that the system can decide which one to show to the app user.

{% hint style="info" %} Remember that **the system evaluates from top to bottom**.  In other words, the first page that matches the user, when starting from the top, will be the one shown in the app, and subsequent ones will not be considered.

Keep this in mind when deciding the order in which you place these pages. {% endhint %}

Move the pages with *Drag&amp;Drop*. Once they're in the desired order, click  **Save order.**

{% hint style="warning" %} You can only have one page that **does not contain audiences** and that page must always be in **last** place. If this condition is not met and you try to save an incorrect order, you will be duly warned by the system. {% endhint %}
