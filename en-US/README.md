### Before starting...

#### What is a modular page?

A modular page is any app page made up of modules.

Modular pages allow you to include modules that can be configured from another CMS (alerts, extras, entry point lists, etc.) as well as other, simpler modules that were previously managed by config.

#### What are the advantages of using this CMS?

- **Preview**. At all times, both when adding a module and when configuring the page, a preview is available that shows the CMS user what the content will look like.
- **Module management**. The modules are easily rearranged and can be activated or deactivated as required.
- **Content structure**. The use of sections helps to organize the content based on the theme of the modules. These sections may or may not be carried into the app.
- **Immediacy of changes**. The changes made in the Modular Pages CMS are implemented practically immediately for app users. Once published, no backend or other release is required.
- **Test changes or configuration before publishing.** With the Content Test tool, you can see what a page will look like on a device before the changes are published.
