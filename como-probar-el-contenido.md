# How to test content

Even though you've already seen how a test is launched in the [Preview](como-crear-una-pagina-modular/vista-previa.md) section, you can learn more about the content testing process below:

### How to publish the content of a test

First, you'll know that a test is running on a page thanks to the **TEST** status tag:

To publish the content of a test, access the page on which that test is running.

When you open the modular page, the content will be split into two different tabs. This will allow you to see the pre-test content and the test content itself at all times.

👋🏽 The name of the other tab refers to the status of the content that is NOT being tested.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only make changes to the content from the **Test** tab. Use the other tab to view the content prior to the changes you made for the test.
{% endhint %}

To **save the changes** made to a test **without publishing them**, click **Save test**:

When you're sure that you want to apply the content shown in all steps of the **Test** tab, click **Save and Publish**. Provide a description of those changes and click **Confirm** to validate and publish the changes.

Click **Close** to return to the main Modular Pages screen.

{% hint style="success" %}
:thumbsup: On the main screen, you will see that the **TEST** tag has disappeared from the status of the modular page.
{% endhint %}

### How to discard a test

If, with a test still in progress, you decide to discard changes after you have tested the content of a modular page, you'll need to access the page on which said test is in progress.

Click **Continue** until you reach the last **Preview** step and then click **Discard test**.

When you discard a test, you discard the changes you had made on the modular page. Both the content and the status of that page will return to how they were before the test.

### How to add, remove or modify Novum user IDs from a test

If you need to edit the test in order to add, remove or modify the users who can view a certain test, access the modular page where the test is located.

From the main screen where all the modular pages are listed, access the sub-menu of the page whose IDs you wish to edit and then click **Edit test information**.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/EditTestInformation.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can also access the page and click **Edit test information** from the last **Preview** step.

In both cases, you can add new user IDs or delete those that already exist. Simply edit the values ​​in the **User ID field (optional)** and click the **Edit test information** button**.**
