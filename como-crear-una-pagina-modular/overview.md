# Overview

In this first step, you'll need to provide general information about the page you are creating.

Fill out the following fields:

**Page Name**. Name of the page you are creating. It is a field for internal use that helps you identify the page. It won't be seen by the app user at any time.

**URL ID**. ID that identifies the page you are creating. This field does not accept spaces, accents or other special characters. It is a unique ID that, once the page has been published, you will not be able to edit.

**Authorization**. Indicates the type of users or the permissions those users must have in order to access the page you are configuring.

**User Group(optional)**. If the page you are creating is going to be displayed to a specific online audience (also called a quick audience), select that audience from the drop-down menu.

### **Product type**

Indicates whether the page is related to the user or the product.

- **No product relevance**. These are user pages, which means that the page does not represent a specific product. Rather, it displays any product or information pertaining to the user e.g. the Start Tab.
- **Products relevance**. The product is relevant, which means that the product is the center of construction of the page. If you select this type of page, 3 possible options will be shown:
    - **Default for products not handled by another page**. This is the option checked by default. It is used for all products that have not been managed by a previous page.
    - **Unique product**. The page represents unique products such as mobile line, land line, TV or a fiber subscription.
    - **More than one product**. The page represents a plan, composed of different sub-products. For example, a fusion, a trio, convergent...

### Tracking

Use the fields in this section to define tracking at the modular page level. Remember that each module also has its own fields.

- **Screen name (optional)**
- **Content Group (optional)**. Select an optional value for this field.
- **Content Category (optional)**. Select an optional value for this field. The values â€‹â€‹displayed will vary depending on the value you entered in the **Content Group** field.

When you have finished configuring all the content of the page, click **Continue** to go to the next step.
