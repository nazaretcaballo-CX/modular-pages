In this last step you will see a summary of the modular page that you have configured.

In this step, you have an opportunity to test the content before it impacts users.

This step gives you information about:

- **Page name**. Internal title of the modular page. This title is not the one that is shown to users. Rather, it is the internal name that you indicated in step **1 Overview**.
- **Screen name**. Default value that the modular page takes based on the **Page name** that you have indicated in step **1 Overview**. This field is used to track the modular page.
- **Product type**. Indicates the type of modular page you have created. Remember that the content of the page may depend on user information or products, or may be related to a product or product package (**User related** or **Product related**).
- **URL ID**. ID of the modular page you are creating or editing.
- **User Group**. Indicates whether the page is configured for a specific user group. If it isn't, the value will be *All users*.

Click **Save** to save the fields or **Save and publish** to save and publish your changes.

### How to create a test

In this last step you are able to test the content you have configured before it impacts a wide mass of users.

#### Test information

Click **Create test** to start a test.

- **Description (optional)**. Use this field to describe the changes or content you want to test. This is an optional field, but it is highly recommended to fill it out since it will help you quickly identify the test you are creating.
-  **User IDs (optional)**. Add one or more user IDs that you wish to test, separated only by commas (no spaces). This field only accepts numeric values.

Click on **Launch test** to test the content.

{% hint style="info" %} **How to obtain the user ID**

1. Make sure you have the Enterprise version of the app downloaded.
2. Open the app
3. Shake the phone
4. Access the "Authentication" section
5. The number you're looking for is the one in the **User ID** field {% endhint %}

When you have finished setting up all the content on the page, click **Publish** to publish the content.

If the content hasn't been published yet, you can save the changes without having to publish them. By clicking **Save**, the page will be saved as a **DRAFT**.

You can also pause the page so that it is not seen by app users. However, if you have made changes to the page, you must save and publish them first. You can then pause the page by clicking **PAUSE**.

{% hint style="success" %} Remember that changes are not saved automatically, and you'll need to get to the last step to save or publish the changes. ü§ì {% endhint %}
